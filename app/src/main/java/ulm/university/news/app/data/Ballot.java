 * The Ballot class represents a ballot. A ballot belongs to a group and offers the participants several options for
 * which each participant can vote. Depending on the properties of the ballot participants can vote for either one
 * option per ballot or for multiple options. The participants can display the result of the voting. However,
 * depending on the properties the votes can be public or anonymous. If the votes are anonymous, the participants can
 * only determine how many votes an option has received. If the votes are public, it can also be determined which
 * participant has voted for a certain option.
